## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!-- 
**dafinny/Dafinny** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on smart grid optimization, EV charging models, and energy forecasting systems.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced high-voltage simulation in COMSOL and GAMS-based OPF modeling.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on intelligent energy systems, embedded grid controls, and ML for power systems.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with embedded real-time implementation of solar-integrated EV charging systems.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about electrical infrastructure design, transformer sizing, load flow/short circuit analysis, or IEEE/IEC standards.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: dafinny1922@gmail.com | +1 (226) 988-0707
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I filed a patent for thermoelectric + solar EV charging (Patent No. 202441032680 A) and published 2 IEEE papers!
